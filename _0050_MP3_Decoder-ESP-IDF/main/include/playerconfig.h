/*Playing a real-time MP3 stream has the added complication of clock differences: if the sample
clock of the server is a bit faster than our sample clock, it will send out mp3 data faster
than we process it and our buffer will fill up. Conversely, if the server clock is slower, we'll
eat up samples quicker than the server provides them and we end up with an empty buffer.
To fix this, the mp3 logic can insert/delete some samples to modify the speed of playback.
If our buffers are filling up too fast (presumably due to a quick sample clock on the other side)
we will increase our playout speed; if our buffers empty too quickly, we will decrease it a bit.
Unfortunately, adding or deleting samples isn't very good for the audio quality. If you
want better quality, turn this off and/or feel free to implement a better algorithm.
WARNING: Don't use this define if you play non-stream files. It will presume the sample clock
on the server side is waaay too fast and will default to playing back the stream too fast.*/
// #define ADD_DEL_SAMPLES

/*ADD_DEL_SAMPLES parameter:
Size of the cumulative buffer offset before we are going to add or remove a sample
The higher this number, the more aggressive we're adjusting the sample rate. Higher numbers give
better resistance to buffer over/underflows due to clock differences, but also can result in
the music sounding higher/lower due to network issues.*/

/*While a large (tens to hundreds of K) buffer is necessary for Internet streams, on a
quiet network and with a direct connection to the stream server, you can get away with
a much smaller buffer. Enabling the following switch will disable accesses to the
23LC1024 code and use a much smaller but internal buffer instead. You want to enable
this if you don't have a 23LC1024 chip connected to the ESP but still want to try
the MP3 decoder. Be warned, if your network isn't 100% quiet and latency-free and/or
the server isn't very close to your ESP, this _will_ lead to stutters in the played
MP3 stream! */
